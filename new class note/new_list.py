# Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the numbers that are present in  both lists, but with each number appearing only once in the final list.

# l1 = [2,10,11,25,234,34,20]
# l2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,6,12,54]

# def new_list(l1,l2):
#     t_list = list(set(l1+l2))
#     return t_list

# new_l = new_list(l1,l2)
# print(f'\n\nNew list is: {new_l}\n\n')
